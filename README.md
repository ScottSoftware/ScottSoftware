## Hi, Iâ€™m Scott!
- I moved out at 17
- I work with a number of programming languages
- My strongest language is Java
- I'm also capable of working with C#, C++, C, ASM, and Python reliably

## My Repositories
I opened this GitHub account and my repositories to demonstrate some of my programming skills through
smaller chunks of code. I don't much care if others use the code in here for their own
purposes, regardless of whether they make money off from it or not, unless it's otherwise stated in 
the repositories license file. I'm glad to discuss any arrangements for code licensing or purchasing.
Feel free to look around and test what you need.

## If you find my code especially useful
I don't need compensation or the like on most of my code, nor do I need you to ask permission to use my
unlicensed code. Most of it is free to all who may see a need in it, though without warranty. However if 
you see fit to donate to me, my email can be found below so you can get in touch. Donating to me 
will help me to continue focusing on software development, and may even pay for my next meal. So thank you, 
even if you don't donate or purchase.

## My story so far
I've been programming since age 12, after moving out at 17 I nabbed myself an apartment, lived through
two girlfriends coming and going, then at 19, I lost my job, apartment, and almost everything else. Now
I live out of my camper, traveling wherever I see fit and developing software as I go. Computers seem
to be my everything, the only constant I have. I enjoy everything I do on them, and will for years to come.
