## Hi, I’m Scott!
- I moved out at 17
- I work with a number of programming languages
- My strongest language is Java
- I'm also capable of working with C#, C++, C, ASM, and Python reliably

## My Repositories
I opened this GitHub account and my repositories to demonstrate some of my programming skills through
smaller chunks of free-use code. I don't much care if others use the code in here for their own
purposes, regardless of whether they make money off from it or not. I'm just glad for people finding 
good uses for my code since I was never good at it. Feel free to look around and use what you need.

## If you find my code especially useful
I don't need compensation or the like on my code, nor do I need you to ask permission to use my code.
It's free to all who may see a need in it, though without warranty. However if you see fit to donate to
me, my CashApp is probably the best place to send any donations. Donating to me will help me to continue
focusing on software development, and may even pay for my next meal. So thank you, even if you don't donate.

## My story so far
I've been programming since age 12, after moving out at 17 I nabbed myself an apartment, lived through
two girlfriends coming and going, then at 19, I lost my job, apartment, and almost everything else. Now
I live out of my camper, traveling wherever I see fit and developing software as I go. Computers seem
to be my everything, the only constant I have. I enjoy everything I do on them, and will for years to come.
